# A note about the "Information Hierarchy" project: it was quickly hacked together for use in the mentioned physics class using the PHP/HTML/CSS I was learning at the time. It was certainly not the most elegant coding I've ever done, but it worked splendidly for my purposes. Also, not all code is included. If you'd like to verify that it runs, let me know, and I'll send along the supporting files.
